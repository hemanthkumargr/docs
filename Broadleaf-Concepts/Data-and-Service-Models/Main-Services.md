## <a name="wiki-orderService"></a> OrderService

The OrderService interface and the default OrderServiceImpl implementation provide you with functionality to interact with orders and carts (they're the same -- check out [[Order (cart) documentation | Main Entities#wiki-order]] for more info). Methods are provided to create carts / wishlists, look them up from the persistence layer, add / remove / update items, etc. Learn more about [[cart operations | Cart Operations]] and their workflows.
